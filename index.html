    <h2>Once upon a time...</h2>
    <p>There was a friendly lion named Leo who lived in a beautiful jungle.</p>
    <p>One sunny morning, Leo decided to explore the jungle and meet new friends.</p>
    <p>As he walked through the tall trees, he came across a playful monkey named Max. They became instant friends and swung from tree to tree together.</p>
    <p>Further ahead, they met a wise owl named Olivia who shared fascinating stories about the jungle and its creatures.</p>
    <p>Leo, Max, and Olivia had a wonderful day exploring the jungle and making memories.</p>
    <p>When the sun started to set, Leo bid goodbye to his new friends and headed back to his cozy den.</p>
    <p>He fell asleep under the moonlit sky, dreaming of the adventures that awaited him the next day.</p>
    <p>The end.</p>
